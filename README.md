image clustering
Image clustering is a technique used in machine learning to group similar images together based on their features. There are several approaches to perform image clustering, and one common method involves the following steps:

Feature Extraction: Convert images into feature vectors that capture important characteristics. Techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to extract these features.

Dimensionality Reduction: Reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors using methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to make clustering more efficient.

Clustering Algorithm: Apply a clustering algorithm like K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, or DBSCAN on the reduced feature vectors to group similar images together.
